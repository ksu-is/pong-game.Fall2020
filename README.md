# Pong-Game
Add and improve to Pong game already started by Joe. The code cloned from Joe is a working game but has limited capabilities.
The main goal is to make the game run seamlessly with no apparent issues.  We plan to add some neat features that donâ€™t already exist in the code such as a enhanced scoreboard with a timer, and the ability for the paddles to wrap around the screen for easier use. 

## How to Play
Move the left paddle by 'w' for up and 's' for down. Move the right paddle by 'up' arrow and 'down' arrow
