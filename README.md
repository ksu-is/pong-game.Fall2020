# Pong-Game
Add and improve to Pong game already started by Joe. The code cloned from Joe is a work in progress and the game isn't playable.
The main goal is to make the game run seamlessly with no apparent issues. Also change the colors and theme.   
Then if I have enough time, I also plan to add some neat features that donâ€™t already exist in the code. 

## How to Play
Move the left paddle by 'w' for up and 's' for down. Move the right paddle by 'up' arrow and 'down' arrow
